#oop  // python is famous thing beacuse og Object oriented Programing
#python supports all different programming paradigm it supports
# functional programming --> basically means if you can achieve a certain task implementing function as our mathematical functions ,where you will not manipulate a  DATA ,which is instead Changing data you will still accomplish a task ,One of the way is you can pass a function to function.......
# object oriented programing
# procedure Oriented Programming


#Concept of OOPs

#Object will have two things every object will have certain attributes and every object will have certain behavior
#Attributes ---> attributr you can image them as data or you can say properties 
#Example my height it's one attribute my age is one attribute.....
#Object will have something that you can store data an object will have some behavior (iam talking , iam walking etc this are come under behaviour )

#// if you want to store something an object we need to define variables
#// if you want to define the behavior we need to use methods 
# 
# what is methods?
#// function in object-oriented  programming they are called as methods


#OOPs is not just about different syntax it's about the way you think //now if you want to achieve anything in programming you need to think about object 


#OOP's have many concepts 
#1)Object - Instance
#2)Class - Design
#3)Encapsulation
#4)Abstraction
#5)Polymorphism
